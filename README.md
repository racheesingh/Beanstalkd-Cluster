# Distributed Message Queue Based Linux Cluster: Setup and Application
This system was built as a weekend assignment for the Data Storage Technology and Networks course at [BITS - Pilani, KK Birla Goa Campus](http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/), under the guidance of [Dr. Biju K. R](www.bits-goa.ac.in/Departments/Faculty/faculty%20pages/biju.htm).

The documentation regarding setting up this cluster in the form of a report can be found in this repository. Also, we implemented some simple parallel algorithms on this cluster. Their code and documentation can also be found in this repository.

# Applications
We plan to build a library of parallel computing algorithms for the benefit of students taking introductory parallel computing courses. As you will see, the setting up process for a beanstalkd cluster is simple and the application programs tiny.

Till now, we have implemented these algorithms:

1. [Distributed Estimation of Pi](https://github.com/emaadmanzoor/distributed-pi-estimation/)

2. Matrix Multiplication

We will continue to add more algorithms as and when we implement them.
